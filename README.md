 This Project has been made to study the performnce of some machine learning classifiers to detect cyber attcks included in phishy emails. A hybrid dataset (phishy and normal emails) was collected from different sources. Preprocessing steps were implemented:
 - Cleaning
 - Normalizing

Five of the most popular classifiers were used:
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- SVM
- K-nearest neighbour
- Logistic Regression

Most Algorithms achieved accuracy more than 90%. Random Forest did the best with 98.5 %
